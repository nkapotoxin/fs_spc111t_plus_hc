class Hints(object):
    """Encapsulate driver hints for listing entities.

    Hints are modifiers that affect the return of entities from a
    list_<entities> operation.  They are typically passed to a driver to give
    direction as to what filtering, pagination or list limiting actions are
    being requested.

    It is optional for a driver to action some or all of the list hints,
    but any filters that it does satisfy must be marked as such by calling
    removing the filter from the list.

    A Hint object contains filters, which is a list of dicts that can be
    accessed publicly. Also it contains a dict called limit, which will
    indicate the amount of data we want to limit our listing to.

    Each filter term consists of:

    * ``name``: the name of the attribute being matched
    * ``value``: the value against which it is being matched
    * ``comparator``: the operation, which can be one of ``equals``,
                      ``startswith`` or ``endswith``
    * ``case_sensitive``: whether any comparison should take account of
                          case
    * ``type``: will always be 'filter'
