    The extension enables providing an option to specify router-ids of
    routers where the firewall is to be installed. This is supported in
    a manner so that the older version of the API continues to be supported.
    On a CREATE, if the router_ids option is not specified then the firewall
    is installed on all routers on the tenant. If the router-ids option is
    provided with a list of routers then the firewall is installed on the
    specified routers. If the router-ids option is provided with an empty
    list then the firewall is created but put in an INACTIVE state to reflect
    that no routers are associated. This firewall can be updated with a list
    of routers which will then drive the state to ACTIVE after the agent
    installs and acks back. UPDATE also supports the option in a similar
    manner. If the router_ids option is not provided, then there is no change
    to the existing association with the routers. When the router_is option is
    provided with a list of routers or an empty list - this drives the new
    set of routers that the firewall is associated with.
