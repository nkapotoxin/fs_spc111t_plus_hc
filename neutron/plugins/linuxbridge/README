# -- Background

The Neutron Linux Bridge plugin has removed from the tree in Juno.  You must 
migrate to ML2 using the script in: neutron/db/migration/migrate_to_ml2.py

# -- Agent configuration

- Edit the configuration file:
  etc/neutron/plugins/linuxbridge/linuxbridge_conf.ini

- Copy neutron/plugins/linuxbridge/agent/linuxbridge_neutron_agent.py
  and etc/neutron/plugins/linuxbridge/linuxbridge_conf.ini
  to the compute node.

- Copy the neutron.conf file to the compute node

  Note: debug and logging information should be updated in etc/neutron.conf

- On each compute node, the network_interface_mappings must be
  configured in linuxbridge_conf.ini to map each physical network name
  to the physical interface connecting the node to that physical
  network. Entries are of the form
  "<physical_network>:<physical_interface>". For example, one compute
  node may use the following physical_inteface_mappings entries:

  [LINUX_BRIDGE]
  physical_interface_mappings = physnet1:eth1,physnet2:eth2,physnet3:eth3

  while another might use:

  [LINUX_BRIDGE]
  physical_interface_mappings = physnet1:em3,physnet2:em2,physnet3:em1


$ Run the following:
  python linuxbridge_neutron_agent.py --config-file neutron.conf
                                      --config-file linuxbridge_conf.ini

  Note that the the user running the agent must have sudo priviliges
  to run various networking commands. Also, the agent can be
  configured to use neutron-rootwrap, limiting what commands it can
  run via sudo. See http://wiki.openstack.org/Packager/Rootwrap for
  details on rootwrap.

  As an alternative to coping the agent python file, if neutron is
  installed on the compute node, the agent can be run as
  bin/neutron-linuxbridge-agent.
